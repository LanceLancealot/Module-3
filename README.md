# Password Generator

## Description

The Password Generator is a web application that allows users to generate strong and secure passwords based on their specified criteria. With the increasing importance of online security, having complex and unique passwords is crucial. This project addresses that need by providing a user-friendly tool to create passwords that provide a high level of protection.

### Motivation

The motivation behind building this Password Generator was to contribute to better online security practices. Many users resort to using weak passwords or reusing passwords across multiple accounts, which poses a significant security risk. By offering a simple and effective way to generate strong passwords, this project aims to encourage safer online habits.

### Problem Solving

The problem this project addresses is the challenge of creating and remembering strong passwords. Traditional methods of generating complex passwords can be cumbersome and difficult to recall. The Password Generator offers an efficient solution by allowing users to customize their passwords while ensuring they meet the criteria for strength.

### Learning Outcomes

Throughout the development of this project, I deepened my understanding of web development concepts, particularly in JavaScript and DOM manipulation. By tackling user input, validation, and dynamic content generation, I gained practical experience in creating interactive and user-friendly interfaces.
